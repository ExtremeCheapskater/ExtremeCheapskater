				<div>My husband is a stay at home Dad and really good at it.  He’s from Indiana and he loves NASCAR.  I call him “The Redneck” both to his face and behind his back. He likes it, although he does not say. I just know.</div>

				<div>We have two little girls…Claire (7) and Hannah (5.)  They are ornery like their parents.  When they are not being good in the car I tell them I’m making a stop at the orphanage on the way home.</div>

						<div> Both of my sisters are a lot more interesting and likeable than I am.  One rides a bike up and down mountains and the other climbs mountains.  I only like mountains from far away.</div>

						<div> My parents are also more interesting than I am.  I’m their favorite child.</div>

						<div> My first job at 13 was working at a Water Park.  I was a trash picker-upper.  I got to carry bee spray with me when I changed the garbage and then put it in this cool trash compactor thingie.  It’s still the best job I’ve ever had.</div>
