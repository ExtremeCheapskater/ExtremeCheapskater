		<p><strong>I only use coupons for things I’m going to buy anyway.</strong></p>
		<p>I even have a nifty coupon organizer book and I ritualistically add to it every weekend.</p>
		<p>I once saw a story about a woman who uses the extreme couponing method to donate to food banks.  THAT is really cool.  If that interests you,  <a href="http://blog.couponsherpa.com/6-ways-to-donate-your-extreme-couponing-surplus/" target="_blank">The Coupon Sherpa</a> site has a great list of ways to give your haul back to the community.  That same site also has a <a href="http://www.couponsherpa.com/downloads/" target="_blank">free coupon download</a> for iPhone and Android.</p>
		<p>Here is why the whole ordeal turns me off…</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Most coupons are for highly processed food.  </strong>Sometimes you can find coupons for eggs, meat and fruit.  These are a good cut.   I stick to the sale ads for my store and typically wait to buy something until it’s on sale.</li>
				<li><strong>I don’t like to be “controlled by the man.”    </strong>This reason may be a good thing to talk to a therapist about or it might be the coolest reason ever.  When something gets very popular I tend to head the other direction unless it really fits into my life like a puzzle piece.   Sometimes this instinct serves me well and sometimes I miss out on something helpful.</li>
				<li><strong>I don’t need cheetoes in my bunker.  </strong>Unless you are stocking up for the Zombie Apocalypse there is no reason to over-stock.  I do stock up on good deals at the grocery store or Costco, but I’m conservative.  We live in an itty bitty house and storage is limited.  (We also have an itty bitty mortgage.)  Some of the coupon guru’s have a “store” in their garage or basement.  Can they possibly use everything?  No.</li>
				<li><strong>There is no twelve step program for extreme couponers.  </strong>I can relate a little bit to the “high” you get from a good deal.  However, if your love of a good deal consumes you like a crack addict then it’s time to examine your motives.</li>
				<li><strong>I buy the store brand most of the time.</strong>   I shop by comparing the price per ounce, pound, etc.  I do love getting the coupons directly from my store.  I use them.  The store brand <em>without a coupon</em> usually beats out the brand name <em>with a coupon</em> every time.</li>
