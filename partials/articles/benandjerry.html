	<p><strong>If you have kids I’ll bet your wish list is similar to mine.</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Let them have a safe place to live.</li>
		<li>Let them be healthy and happy.</li>
		<li>Let them learn well in school.</li>
		<li>Let them not meet a guy from a band, dye their hair into a purple mohawk and run away to California to live in a van.</li>

		<p>Along with kids came the stress that I will lose my job and not being able to take care of them.</p>
		<p>Every day I read about some company somewhere having to cut costs and let people go.   Since I got married and had children I’ve been laid off twice and gone to jail once.  Ok.  I made up that last part.   I thought it might make me sound spicy.</p>
		<p>We’ve had one advantage though…I’ve unfortunately worked for companies where I knew I might get laid off the week after I started.  It kept us in a constant state of preparedness that I don’t think will ever wear off. </p>
		<p><strong>When I was pregnant with my second child I had this conversation with my very considerate boss.</strong></p>
		<p>Boss: <em> (Intense look on her face.)</em> <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Amy.  When are you due?</span><br>
		Me:   <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">In about a month.</span><br>
		Boss:  <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ok.  You need to go to your Dr. and tell her you need to get induced two weeks early.</span><br>
		Me:  (Intense look on my face.) <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ok.  Why?</span><br>
		Boss:  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Because we’ll be laid off by your due date and you won’t have your insurance.</em></span></em></em></em></em></p>
		<p><span style="color: #000000;">I sat in my bed that night eating half-off Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream…stewing</span>. </p>
		<p><strong>As much as I tried to not panic I could not stop myself.</strong></p>
		<p>I was wondering… <em>what in the hell are we going to do?  </em></p>
		<p><em>How will we pay the mortgage?  </em></p>
		<p><em>Do I need a special “I just got laid off”  identity card to get into the food bank?  </em></p>
		<p><em>Do they have Ben & Jerry’s?</em></p>
		<p>In the end it worked out ok.  We did not have mountains of money in our savings but we had enough to last 3 months with some left over. </p>
		<p>The new job I took paid a lot less so I took a job writing at night to supplement my income.  But…everything was <em>OK.  </em></p>
		<p><strong>We weren’t rich but we’d saved enough to get through the crisis.  <em>  </em></strong> </p>
		<p>When I ask myself why I am “cheap” that time-frame is what I remember.   </p>
		<p>Being cheap is a kind of insurance for me.   Can I keep my family safe and fed even if the crap hits the fan?  Will I have options or will I have to get a managerial position at Burger King and bring home left-over whoppers for dinner?</p>
		<p>I still worry about all the things I worried about before…but I <em>prepare.  </em>That way…I don’t HAVE to worry about the money part as much.  </p>
		<p><strong>I know things happen I can’t prepare for.  Saving money is something I can control if I make it a priority.</strong></p>
		<p>I can play with my kids and not have that nagging terror in the back of my mind.  I can spend my energy on other things…like studying with them or watching them do kung-foo with my <a title="10 Things You Don’t Know About Me. (And could probably live your whole life not knowing.)" href="#Index#mainArticle">Redneck Husband. </a> And…I don’t have to worry if the food bank has Cherry Garcia. </p>
